# stadiaTimeBox

Fires up Stadia in a Chrome browser, runs a countdown timer in the background, kills Chrome after 90 minutes.
 
 
 Remaining time can be viewed on host machine port 6357, CORS enabled so countdown timer can be viewed by any device on the same network (eg mobile phone).

## TO DO (maybe)
- Swanky front end
- Initial config page that allows user to define allowed play time
- Build folder
